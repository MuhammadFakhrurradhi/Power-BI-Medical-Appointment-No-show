A healthcare facility provides a range of services that necessitate customers to make advance appointments. These services encompass medical consultations, minor surgeries, blood tests, and more. Although most clients adhere to their scheduled appointments, approximately many of patients do not show up. Such instances of no-shows result in significant costs for the medical center, as valuable time slots are left unused, potentially depriving other patients who could have attended. Moreover, patients who miss their appointments also miss out on an opportunity to address their health needs. To mitigate the impact of no-shows, the medical center aims to proactively reach out to patients who are likely to miss their appointments. This involves sending reminders via calls or text messages to prompt attendance or offer the option of rescheduling.

Out of a total of 110,527 appointments scheduled by patients, approximately 80% of these appointments resulted in no-shows, with only around 22,000 appointments being successfully attended. This indicates that patients have a tendency to miss appointments that have been scheduled, potentially resulting in losses within the healthcare industry.

The "appointment gap" refers to the duration between the date when patients register for an appointment and the actual appointment date. As depicted above, for appointment gaps of 0-4 weeks, patients who did not receive a reminder via SMS notification have a higher percentage of missed appointments compared to patients who received the notification.

SMS notifications play a significant role in reducing the percentage of no-shows. This effect is evident in the graph above, where at certain times, the gap in the percentage of no-shows between patients who receive notifications and those who do not is approximately 10%.

Patients with medical conditions like diabetes and hypertension exhibit a lower percentage of no-shows. This trend is likely due to the fact that these patients require treatment or consultation regarding their specific conditions from the doctor.

Weekday doctor's appointment no-shows are frequently influenced by work obligations, time limitations, traffic congestion, childcare responsibilities, healthcare fatigue, and scheduling difficulties. Additionally, the lack of reminders and a preference for rest can contribute to this trend. Strategies like flexible scheduling and effective reminders can be employed to mitigate weekday appointment absences.
